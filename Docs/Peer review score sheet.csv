All I would want to see is more levels / gameplay."Merge Conflict,Cat and Mouse,,100,"Genuinly fun platformer. A few player affordances would make gameplay a little more enjoyable, but this game is very solid."Koyaanis Roads,Traffic simulator,,90,"Some graphical glitches and errors, but no gameplay issues. Hard to comment on the final vision without simulation mode."Team Silver Snake,Survival game,,90,"Interesting concept; I can see the melding of Minecraft and Skyrim the authors talked about, but there just aren't enough features to entice gameplay yet."The College Trail,Oregon Trail for College,,70,I didn't really get the point of this game. There aren't a lot of choices or actions for the player to take.Team Meh,Kinect fighter,,90,"Very solid core with the balancing act, but now it needs expansion to give the player more replay value."Failgelson,Top-down stealth game,,100,My gameLemniscate,Time travel game,,80,Probably the most unique concept in the class. Gameplay was a little unclear without some sort of tutorial or HUD.NUITTeam,Downball,,90,Fairly solid core that should allow for easy expansion with more levels and varied map terrain. Controls on Kinect need a little fine-tuning.
